# opticalflow
use Horn-Schuck method to estimate optical flow in MATLAB

Welcome to visit my Github!

This project is a solution for Assignment 3 Optical Flow Estimation of the course Image Processing and Computer Vision (ENGG 5104, CUHK, 2015 Spring: http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/engg5104). In this project, I implement an algorithm solving the optical flow map (u,v) between two image frames using Horn-Schunck Method.

For more information about the principle and experimental result of this project, please refer to my report: http://izhengfan.github.io/opticalflow.html


How to run my code:

Just open the folder in MATLAB and run file runflow.m. To test different images pairs, just change input file name to the 'imread' function at the beginning of runflow.m.
